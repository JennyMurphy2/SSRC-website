To date, a host of research has identified concerns with the replication of psychological research, leading to the formation of projects such as the Many Labs, STORK (Society for Transparency, Openness and Replication in Kinesiology), and the Reproducibility Project in Psychology.

This field is under threat from low sample sizes, high risk of bias, and invested interests in the outcomes of applied or commercial findings for sport (Heneghan et al, 2012[^1]; Knudson, 2017[^2]; Halperin et al, 2018)[^3]. 

Scientific progress may be halted because of questionable research practices and the focus on novel or unexpected results. Therefore, the Sports Science Replication Centre intends to investigate the credibility of these replication concerns within our own field, to improve the standard of scientific enquiry, thus leading to a better understanding in the interpretation and conduct of research for all moving forward.
