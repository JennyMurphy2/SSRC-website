Background

Supervised by Dr. Joe Warne





What is replication?

Replication is retesting a claim using

the same analyses and new data

(Nosek et al, 2020)

*Same*

*methods*

*New*

*sample and*

*data*

*Compare*

Reproducibility is retesting a claim

Why replicate?

Rigorous science is the

“*theoretical or*

*experimental approaches*

*undertaken in a way that*

*enhances confidence in*

*the veracity of their*

*findings*”

Knowledge is

uncertain

Purpose:

• Increase confidence in findings

• Reaffirm findings

(Casadevall and Fang, 2016, p1)

• Update boundaries on external validity

• Identify type 1 errors





The problem with Sports Science

Focus on novel or

exciting effects

Questionable

research practices

Invested interests

Low statistical

power & small

sample sizes

Lack of

transparency

The Sports Science Replication Centre

**Aim**

• Evaluate the replicability of sports science research

**Objectives**

• Establish a collaborative lab network worldwide

• Undertake replication trials of different effects

• Report replication outcomes using meta-analytic procedures

• Present an initial overview of the replicability of sports science

research

Why become involved?

\1. Contribute towards the first

*collaborative* replication project

in sports and exercise science

\4. Write up and *final analysis*

*will be completed* by the team

leader

\2. Lead the way towards*open*

*science* in the field

\5. Each lab will receive a study

that is *feasible* to conduct

\3. All *methods and analysis are*

*preplanned* by the team leader

\6.

Each author who makes a

substantial contribution will

receive *authorship*

Assessing the outcomes

Multiple inferential strategy

Descriptive information

\1. Replication effect size is

statistically significant

\1. Normalized differences in

the magnitude of the

effect sizes

\2. Same direction as

original effect size

\2. Included and excluded

studies as per selection

protocol

\3. Original effect size falls

into 95% confidence

interval of replication

effect size

\3. Original author response
